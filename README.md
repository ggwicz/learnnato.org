### A simple way to learn and practice the NATO phonetic alphabet.

You already know _some_ of [the NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) without even realizing it. `Alpha`, `Bravo`, and `Charlie` are examples of NATO code words, standing for `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively. "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot" is another example, and shows up in [a number of places in popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Tango_Foxtrot).

**Knowing this alphabet is quite useful**. It was specifically designed to remove ambiguity from radio communications, and is mainly used in military and aviation contexts. But communicating clearly over audio is valuble for all of usâ€”if you've ever had to spell an address, your last name, the name of a medication, or anything else over the phone, you'll know how easy it is for your `M` to be misheard as `N`, `D` mistaken for `P`, `A` misheard as `J`, and so on.

LearnNATO.org is a fun and simple way to get familiar with these code words and practice your knowledge of them!
